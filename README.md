This project integrates a quadrature decoder to interpret signals from rotary encoders, enabling precise control inputs for arcade games. 
In the context of Pong, such a decoder translates the rotational movement of a knob or encoder into digital signals that control the paddle's position on the screen.

# Technical Implementation

‚Ä¢ The .srcs directory likely contains Verilog modules responsible for the quadrature decoding logic and game mechanics.

‚Ä¢ .sim directory suggests the presence of simulation setups, possibly using Xilinx's XSIM, to test and validate the design.

‚Ä¢ Files like .xpr and directories such as .gen and .hw indicate that the project was developed using Xilinx Vivado, a popular FPGA design suite.

# üìÅ tb_bram.v: Testbench for Block RAM (BRAM)

This file is a testbench module for verifying the behavior of a custom BRAM module. Key features:

‚Ä¢ Parameters:

RAM_WIDTH = 32: Width of each memory word.

RAM_ADDR_BITS = 9: 512-word addressable space.

‚Ä¢ Inputs/Regs:

clk: Clock signal (5 ns period toggle).

ram_enable, write_enable: Control signals for BRAM access.

address, input_data: Used to simulate write operations.

Square position registers (e.g., sq_c_x1, sq_d1_y2): Likely related to game object coordinates.

‚Ä¢ Behavior:

Instantiates the bram module with specific parameters.

Generates a clock.

Runs a loop to write values into BRAM.

This testbench sets up and simulates writing data to BRAM which likely stores pixel or game-object data.

# üìÅ Nexys-A7-100T-Master.xdc: FPGA Constraints File

This file maps FPGA physical pins to logical ports in your design, tailored for the Nexys A7-100T board.

‚Ä¢ Key Mappings:

Clock: clk is mapped to pin W5.

VGA Output: RGB and sync signals (e.g., vga_R, vga_G, vga_h_sync) are mapped to appropriate FPGA pins.

‚Ä¢ Quadrature Inputs:

quadA ‚Üí pin B18

quadB ‚Üí pin A18

This confirms the use of rotary encoders, where quadA and quadB are the two signals typically used to detect direction and rotation amount in quadrature encoding.

# üß† Summary of the Full Systems

‚Ä¢ Use rotary encoder signals to control paddle movement in a game like Pong.

‚Ä¢ Decode quadrature signals using FPGA logic (implemented in Verilog).

‚Ä¢ Drive VGA output for gameplay display.

‚Ä¢ Use BRAM to store graphics/game states like paddle and ball coordinates.
